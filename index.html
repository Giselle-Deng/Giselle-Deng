  The map on the right explores the airbnb listings in 2017 based on different room types. Airbnb hosts can list entrie homes/apartments, private or shared rooms. Generally, the prices for staying in an entire apartment are much more expensive than staying in private or shared room. There are more available entire homes and private room listings than shared room airbnb. However, the price for staying in a private room are not always higher than staying in a shared room. Meanwhile, depending on the number of listings in each neighborhood, the average prices for renting an entire apartment in Financial District are about $481/night. Travellers might consider airbnbs in other neighborhood instead of staying in the Financial District. Surprisely, even though there are a lot of listings in West Addition, the average airbnb price per night in here are still relatively high.
