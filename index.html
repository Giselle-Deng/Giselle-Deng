	</h1> 

<p>In 2008, many hotels around the world were struggling how to survive through the global financial crisis. At the same time, a new San Francisco-based company, Airbnb, was born. Airbnb has changed the travel lodging industry. It leverages the sharing economy as a new way of meeting the needs of visitors and driving the econmoic impact of tourism to neighborhoods throughout the city, highlighting local Airbnb hosts who welcome and share their love of the city with vistors. As of today, Airbnb is now prevalent in over 190 countries, where it has 4 million listings worldwide. That's more listings than the top 5 major hotel brands combined.

<p> There are 3 types airbnbs in the map, which are entire apartment, private room, and share room. Generally, the prices for staying in an entire apartment are much more expensive than staying in one room. However, the price for a private room are not always higher than staying in a share room. Travllers might consider stay in other neighborhood rather than Financial District, since the average prices for renting an entire apartment in here are about $481. Though there are a lot of listings in west addition, but the average airbnb prices in this neighborhood are relatively high. After all, the average price for staying in airbnb is still lower than in hotel.
